PY;Hello World!;1. Introduction to Python*Python is a popular, high-level programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It is widely used in various fields such as web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and automation.**Before diving into coding, let’s ensure you have Python installed on your computer. Visit the official Python website to download and install Python.**2. Writing Your First Python Program*The traditional first program in any programming language is called "Hello, World!"—this program prints the text "Hello, World!" to the screen.**Here’s what the code looks like in Python:**python*print("Hello, World!")*3. Summary*In this lesson, we learned how to write and run a basic Python program.;Complete
PY;Data Types and Variables;1. Understanding Data Types*Python has several built-in data types, including integers, floats, strings, and booleans.**2. Variables*Variables are used to store data. You can assign a value to a variable using the equals sign (=).**Example:**python*x = 5*3. Summary*In this lesson, we learned about Python's data types and how to create variables.;Complete
PY;Control Flow;1. Conditional Statements*Python uses if, elif, and else statements to control the flow of your program based on conditions.**2. Loops*Loops allow you to execute a block of code multiple times. The two main types are for loops and while loops.**3. Summary*In this lesson, we explored control flow using conditional statements and loops.;Complete
PY;Functions and Modules;1. What is a Function?*A function is a block of reusable code that performs a specific task.**2. Defining a Function*You define a function using the def keyword.**Example:**python*def greet():*    print("Hello!")*3. Summary*In this lesson, we learned about functions, how to define them, and the importance of modules in organizing code.;Complete
