PY;hello world;1. Introduction to Python*Python is a popular, high-level programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It is widely used in various fields such as web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and automation.**Before diving into coding, let’s ensure you have Python installed on your computer. Visit the official Python website to download and install Python.**2. Writing Your First Python Program*The traditional first program in any programming language is called “Hello, World!” — this program prints the text "Hello, World!" to the screen.**Here’s what the code looks like in Python:**python*Copy code*print("Hello, World!")*Explanation:**The print() function outputs whatever is inside the parentheses.*"Hello, World!" is a string (a sequence of characters) that will be displayed on the screen.*Exercise:**Open your code editor (or IDLE, Python's integrated development environment).*Type the print() code above.*Run the program. You should see the text Hello, World! printed.*3. Understanding Basic Concepts*Comments:*Comments are lines in the code that Python ignores when running the program. They are used to explain the code or leave notes. In Python, comments start with #.**Example:**python*Copy code*# This is a comment*print("Hello, World!")  # This prints a message*Indentation:*Python uses indentation (spaces or tabs at the beginning of lines) to define blocks of code. Unlike some other languages, Python doesn't use braces {} for this purpose.**4. Common Errors*Syntax Errors:*Occur when Python doesn’t understand the code (e.g., missing parentheses or incorrect indentation). Example:**python*Copy code*print "Hello, World!"  # Missing parentheses, this will cause an error*Case Sensitivity:*Python is case-sensitive, so print is different from Print or PRINT. Always ensure the correct case is used.**5. Summary*In this lesson, we:**Learned how to write and run a basic Python program.*Used the print() function to display text on the screen.*Discussed basic concepts like comments and indentation.*Next Steps:*Practice writing simple programs using the print() function. In the next module, we will explore variables and data types in Python.;Incomplete
