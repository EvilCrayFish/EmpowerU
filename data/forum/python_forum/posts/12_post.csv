Best Python libraries for data visualization?,08/03/2024,18:00,Barry Allen
’ve been exploring different Python libraries for data visualization and I’m not sure which one to choose. I’ve come across Matplotlib Seaborn Plotly Bokeh and a few others. While each library seems to have its strengths and weaknesses I’m wondering which one is best suited for different types of visualizations. For example should I use Matplotlib for simple plots or can Seaborn handle those as well? Is Plotly better for interactive charts? What about performance considerations? Is there any specific library that works best for real-time data visualization or when working with large datasets? Also I’m interested in learning whether any of these libraries are easier to integrate with web applications or dashboards. I’ve seen people use Dash with Plotly but is that the best choice? Would love some detailed feedback!
