What is the best approach to unit testing Python applications that make extensive use of third-party APIs and external services?,08/03/2024,16:15,Caitlin Snow
I’m building a Python application that interacts heavily with third-party APIs and external services. Writing unit tests for this type of application has been challenging because of the dependency on external resources. I’ve read about mocking external services using libraries like unittest.mock or using third-party libraries like responses or VCR.py to simulate API responses. However I’m not sure which approach is best in terms of reliability ease of use and maintainability. Should I mock API responses or would it be better to use integration tests that actually interact with the live APIs? Additionally, I’m concerned about handling rate limits and ensuring the tests don’t fail due to temporary network issues. How do you strike the right balance between testing core application logic and ensuring external services work as expected? Would appreciate any detailed advice or examples of testing strategies in these scenarios!
